# Welcome To Battlefood

Battlefood is a concept game to help understand Polymer 3 better. Feel free to clone it and work on adding features, optimizing the code, or just expanding the game. [Polymer 3](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) are new technologies and are under constant development. Some of the code in this project may not adhere to current best practices.

You can preview the game at http://straley.net/battlefood.

This game is based on a slightly earlier version of the [PWA Starter Kit](https://pwa-starter-kit.polymer-project.org/). It also uses [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/). You should go through the Getting Started guides for both.

The current version of the game does not use any server-side operations -- so no storage of scores, no logging in, no sharing, etc. Also, it is not optimized for mobile and requires desktop screen resolution.

## Getting Started

In order to play with this code, start by cloning it to your local development environment:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/straley/battlefood.git
```

Then, change to the directory and build the node modules:

```bash
$ cd battlefood
$ npm install
```

If you haven't install the Polymer CLI tools yet, type:

```bash
$ npm install -g polymer-cli
```

Then, to start the game locally:

```bash
$ polymer serve
```

In your browser, go to http://localhost:8000/.
